Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps with projects either solo or with teams because all your work saves and if you work with anyone, the work that you do will merge. It is also easy to keep track of files as you have branches that can categorize topics/code files.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be used everywhere as many places use data to solve problems. It is used for predicting outcomes, decision making, etc. Since data scinece takes raw data and uses it for predictions then one example is Financing. Finance needs to track data of stocks and use data given to guess the best possible investment.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Rebase replays the changes we made from our q3 branch on our main branch, while merging applies changes to the current branch we are on. 

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to managing data and using Git/Github. I know git is important in computer science but I have never experimented with git outside of academic purposes and I want to eventually do that comfortably.
